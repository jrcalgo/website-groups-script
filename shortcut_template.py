### copy this file and rename it to whatever you want.

from websites import open_url_group
## when you make your own shortcut script:
## ensure you refactor this method call to your group name... unless 'your_group_name_here' is your group name, in which
## case you can just leave it as it is. 
open_url_group('your_group_name_here')

## It's highly recommended that you write your shortcut scripts here in this same directory and then make shortcut pointer
## file types for your desktop/other directories. This is really just to maintain organization and refactorability.
